Hhere are Common issues and problem that you (JAX) has in coding

1.  In JSX and React, every element must be validly nested as per HTML rules to avoid hydration issues.
    In HTML, <div> cannot be a descendant of <p>.
    In HTML, <a> cannot be a descendant of <a>.
2.  not always finding the rtight time to use "use client:. you often for get the ‘use client’ new features.
3.  use REACT 18+, NEXT 14+.  
    3a. things like the no longer used features : \_app.js
    3b. the page folder no longer used
4.  Putting path and file name header comments for all code
5.  Prop-types. Do not forget this. Use Prop-type every where you should (both the import and the setting), of course DONT use it where not needed.
6.  when removing or changing UseEffect (or similar), checkl
7.  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency
8.  Assigned a value but never used. no-unused-vars
9.  xxxx is not defined. no-undef
10. in MUI Grid is being phased out - go right to the stable Grid2
11. Re-Renders
    --> Minimize Repetitive State Updates
    Debounce or batch any rapid changes (e.g., slider drags, text input) so you don’t trigger frequent state updates that cause re-renders.
    --> Memoize or Use Callbacks
    Wrap expensive operations and callbacks in useMemo or useCallback, ensuring they only recalculate when dependencies actually change.
    --> Centralize Shared State
    Keep global or shared settings in a context or top-level store so you don’t duplicate logic or fetch data from multiple places.
    --> Avoid Circular Dependencies
    Separate “validation” from “updates” so one doesn’t continually trigger the other, causing loops of re-renders.
