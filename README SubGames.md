Sub-Game Descriptions

1. Artist Quiz
	•	Description:
Players listen to a snippet of a tango song and guess the correct artist from four multiple-choice options. Scoring is dynamic, based on the configured time limit (3-15 seconds) and penalties for incorrect answers. Faster responses yield higher scores. The session includes a configurable number of songs, and cumulative scores are tracked.
	•	Timeline: This feature is fully implemented and serves as the foundational game mode.

2. Artist Train
	•	Description:
Players select a specific artist and optionally filter by a “style” (e.g., Tango, Vals, Milonga). The app plays random snippets of songs matching the selected criteria. There’s no scoring, and players can press “Next” to skip to another random snippet or “Done” to end the session. Each snippet lasts a maximum of 15 seconds.

3. Decade Quiz
	•	Description:
Players listen to a random snippet of a tango song and select the decade in which the song was recorded. The decade options are presented as ranges (e.g., 1920-1930, 1931-1940), and players can configure the range size from 4 to 15 years. Scoring follows a similar dynamic as the Artist Quiz, with higher scores for faster, correct answers and penalties for incorrect guesses.
